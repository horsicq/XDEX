Programs for Android are commonly written in Java and compiled to bytecode for the Java virtual machine, which is then translated to **Dalvik bytecode** and stored in .dex (**Dalvik EXecutable**) and .odex (**Optimized Dalvik EXecutable**) files; related terms odex and de-odex are associated with respective bytecode conversions. The compact Dalvik Executable format is designed for systems that are constrained in terms of memory and processor speed.
